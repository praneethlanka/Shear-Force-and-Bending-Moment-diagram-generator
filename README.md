# Shear-Force-and-Bending-Moment-diagram-generator
This MATLAB program helps you to generate the Shear Force and Bending Moment diagrams for a any type of simple loading.
The program can generate the reaction forces of a given beam and it calculates the shear force and bending moment acting at each point. 
Finally the shear force and bending moment graphs will be plotted against the length of the beam.

This work can further be continued by calculating the bending and shear stresses at each point for the given cross-section of the beam
